LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

Build java application which follows an object-oriented approach with real-world classes like Book, User, and Library. The application allows regular users to register, issue, and return books, while admin users can manage the library collection securely.


 Features
 For Users:
 Register with a unique User ID and Name.

 View available books in the library (issued books are hidden).

 Issue books using Book ID (only if available).

 Return previously issued books.

 View all books currently issued.

 Get a report of books borrowed by a specific user.

 For Admin:
- Admin Credentials:
  Username: admin, Password: admin123

 Secure admin login with credentials.

 Add new books to the library.

 Remove books (only if not issued).

 Ensures only admins can modify the library collection.

 Technologies Used
- Java (OOP, Collections, Scanner for input)

- HashMap & ArrayList for data storage (in-memory)
